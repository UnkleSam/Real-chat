# Real-chat
Real-time Chat app
This is a Real-time chat app hosted on your local server using React Js and in the backend Node Js

To run the app open your code editor go to the backend folder 
in the terminal enter **"npm run start**" make sure you are in the correct directory ie "backend"

after you run this command your server should be up and running and then in the request.client file 
Enter "Send Request" to check if it is able to send the request (it should be at the top of your code)

**Make sure to replace the project id and secret key with your own by creating an account on "**Chatengine.io**" (its free in case you are wondering)
**
coming to the Front-end
open another terminal after running your backend server 
Type "**npm run dev**" a local host link would be generated, follow the link in your web browser and type in your username and voila your chat app is up and running.
